# CrewAI_Agent
Autonomous multi-agent system using CrewAI, LangChain, and OpenAI GPT for collaborative task execution. Agents with distinct roles (Researcher, Analyst, Writer) use structured workflows and integrated tools (Wikipedia, SerpAPI, FileWriter) to autonomously generate technical blog content. Ideal for building LLM-powered agentic pipelines.
